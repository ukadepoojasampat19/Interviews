Program Practice on inheritance
Q1. Write a program to crate class name as Value with single function name as setValue(int,int) and 
we have to create three child classes name as Add with function int getAdd() , Mul with function 
getMul() and Div with function getDiv() and getAdd() function return addition of two value which is 
inherited from Value class , getMul() function return multiplication of two values which is inherited 
from Value class and gitDiv() function return division of two values which Is inherited from Value 
class.
Q2. Write program to create class name Area with methods name as void setRadius(float radius) and 
void setLengthWidth(int len,int wid) and two child classes name as Circle and Rectangle so you have 
to define float getCircleArea() method in Circle child class and calculate area of circle and return it

and You have to define getRectArea() method in Rectangle class and calculate area of rectangle and
return it 
Q3. Write Program create class name as ArrSum with method void setValue(int arr[]) you have to 
create child class name as GetSum with method int getArrSum() you have to accept array values 
from ArrSum and calculate its sum and return it 
Q4. Write program to Create class name as PersonalInfo with parameterized constructor 
PersonalInfo(String name, String middlename, String lastname) and you have to create class name as 
ProfessionalInfo with parameterized constructor like as ProfessionalInfo(int id,String des,int 
salary,String skillset) and you have to inherit PersonalInfo class in ProfessionalInfo and pass 
parameter from ProfessionalInfo class to PersonalInfo using super() constructor and you have to 
define void show() method in ProfessionalInfo and you have to show the all data in show() method.
Q5. Write Program to perform method overriding you have to create class name as ArrParent with 
method
void setValue(int arr[]): this method can accept array as parameter 
void arrangeSeq(): this method can display array as per user input sequence
You have to create two child class name as ArrangeAscendingOrder and you have to inherit 
ArrParent class in it and override arrangeSeq() method in ArrangeAscendingOrder and sort array and 
display in ascending order and you have to create one more class name ReverseArray and override 
arrangeSeq() method from ArrParent and reverse array and display it.
Q6. Write Program to create abstract class name as Value with one abstract and one non abstract 
method 
void setValue(int ,int): this is non abstract method with two parameter 
abstract int getResult(): this is abstract method 
and you have two child class name as Power and you have to override getResult() method in Power 
class and calculate power of two values and return it as well as SearchDigit and you have to override 
getResult() consider first parameter of setValue() is number and second parameter is digit and you 
have to search digit in number and return it and if digit not found return -1
Q7. Write Program to create class name as ArrAbs with two methods 
void setArray(int arr[],int []): this function is used for accept array as parameter
abstract int [] getResultantArray(): this function can return resultant array from different child 
classes.
You have to create two classes name as InterSection you have to override getResultantArray() 
method in Intersection and perform intersection of array which we pass in setArray() function and 
return it as well as you have to create one more class name as Union you have to override 
getResultantArray() and perform union on two array and return resultant array

void setCharArr(char []): this function is used for accept array as parameter 
char [] getArrResult(): this is abstract function and return character array as result.
You have to create two implementer class name as ConvertToUpper and ChangeAlterNateChar you 
have to implement the CharOperator interface in ConvertToUpper class and override both methods 
and convert lower case character to upper case and you have to implement the CharOperator in 
ChangeAlterNateChar and override both methods and convert even position character as Upper and 
odd position characters in lower.
Q9. Write a program to create Demonstrate code for multiple inheritance using interface.
