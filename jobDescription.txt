## Interview Questions for a Software Development Engineer Role

### Technical Skills

**Core Programming:**

* **Data Structures and Algorithms:**
  * Can you explain the difference between a stack and a queue?
  ->
  Both stacks and queues are linear data structures, but they differ in how elements are accessed:
  Stack: Follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. The last element added is the first to be removed.
  eg : n everyday analogy would be a stack of platesâ€”where you add a plate on top and remove the top one when needed.
  Queue: Follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. The first element added is the first to be removed.
   real-world analogy for a queue would be a line at a movie theater, where the first person in line is the first one to get the ticket.


  * How would you implement a linked list?
  ->
  A linked list is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are linked together using pointers. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store data in contiguous memory locations; instead, each node points to the next node in the sequence.

  Types of Linked Lists:
Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node. Traversal is one-way (forward).
Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous node. Traversal can be done in both directions (forward and backward).
Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. This can be singly or doubly linked

Types of Linked Lists:
Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node. Traversal is one-way (forward).
Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and the previous node. Traversal can be done in both directions (forward and backward).
Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle. This can be singly or doubly linked.
Basic Operations:
Insertion: Adding a node at the beginning, end, or any position in the list.
Deletion: Removing a node from the list.
Traversal: Going through the nodes one by one to access or print data.
Searching: Finding a specific node based on its value

 * whic is better array or linkedlist?
 ->
 arrays are better when fast, random access and efficient memory usage are critical, while linked lists are better when dynamic memory and frequent insertions/deletions are needed.
 Array :
 Arrays use contiguous memory allocation.
The size of the array is fixed once it is declared.
This can lead to either wasted space (if the array is underutilized) or memory overflow (if the array needs more space).

Linked List:
Linked lists use dynamic memory allocation. Each node is stored separately in memory.
They can grow or shrink in size as needed.
However, each node in a linked list requires extra memory for storing the pointer/reference to the next node.



  * What is the time complexity of a bubble sort algorithm?
  ->general case it sis o(n^2)
    but if the array is completly sorted the time complexity will be o(n).
    eg: 
    bool flag = false;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
      for(int j=i+1;j<n;j++)
      {
         if(arr[i] > arr[j])
         {
            flag = true;
         }
      }
      if(flag == false) break;
    }
    //in the above case the time complexity will be o(n)

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  * What are the four pillars of OOP (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction)?
  ->
    Inheritance means acquire properties from parent class as well as add new property in child class called as inheritance.
    Polymorphism : one object behaves differently in different suitation as per the requirment.
    encapusation :bind the data (variables) and methods working on a same data together in a single unit called class.(it means at implementaion level the data is hide)
    key concepts:
    data hiding: data is hide at implementation level
    access control : private, protected.

    key benefits:
    1)reusability of a code
    2)data security flexibility
    
    example :public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age >= 0) {
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Age cannot be negative.");
        }
    }
}
In this example, the Person class encapsulates the name and age data members, and provides public methods to access and modify them. The setAge method includes a check to ensure that the age is not negative, demonstrating how encapsulation can be used to enforce data integrity.

    
    abstraction : means at design level the the data is hide
    (PENDING) 
  * Can you explain the concept of interfaces and abstract classes?
  ->
  Interfaces

Definition: An interface is a blueprint of a class that specifies the methods that a class must implement without providing any implementation details. It acts as a contract that classes must adhere to.
Key characteristics:
Interfaces can only contain method declarations, not method bodies.
Interfaces cannot have instance variables.
Classes can implement multiple interfaces
interface Drawable {
    void draw();
}

class Circle implements Drawable {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Drawable {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }
}

Abstract Classes

Definition: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It can contain both abstract methods (methods without a body) and concrete methods (methods with a body).

Key characteristics:
Abstract classes can have instance variables.
Subclasses must provide implementations for all abstract methods inherited from the abstract class.
Abstract classes can have concrete methods.
abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();

    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Printing a shape.");
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle.");
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }
}
both interfaces and abstract classes are powerful tools for creating reusable and maintainable code. Interfaces are suitable for defining contracts between unrelated classes, while abstract classes are useful for providing a common base for related classes.


  * How do you implement inheritance in JavaScript?
* **JavaScript:**
  * What is the difference between `let`, `var`, and `const`?
  -> let and const have block level scope and var has function level scope

  * Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.
  -> 
  referencing a varibale before it declaration means hoisting in javascript;
  for var : it will give us the undefine value
  and for let and const it will give us the reference error.

  * How do you handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript (callbacks, Promises, async/await)?
  ->
  async fetchapi(url)  // this is an asyncronoue function which will not affect the main thread of the program and executes itas task with other syncronous operation currently.
  {
     try
     {
        const response = await fetch("url"); // this await will pause the current execution by eneteerig it in to the event queue once the data is fetch from the url then it remove from queuen and event loop will execute the task and then the below code will execute.
        const data = await response.json();
     }
     catch(error)   // if error occur it get handel by catch 
     {
       console.log(error);
     }
      
  }

  fetchapi("http://example.com")  //async function will return the promise : means and object which tells us the the completion or failure of the asynchronous functions.
  .then(data =>{   // if the promise is true then the evenet loop will execute the callback funtion means the work which should be done when the promise is true.
    console.log(data);
  })
  catch(error)
  {
    console.log(error);
  }
